# • takes the direction of travel as a parameter in the form ‘N’ for north, ‘S’ for south,
# ‘E’ for east or ‘W’ for west
# • takes the number of minutes that the bird has been flying (to the nearest minute) as
# a parameter
# • calculates the distance travelled by the bird using the formula:
# distance travelled = (distance per hour / 60) * minutes flying
# • updates the vertical or horizontal position using the distance calculated.
# You do not need to validate the parameters.
# Write program code for Move()

# The main program needs to:
# Output a message that includes the species and current X position and Y position for each bird
# Prompt the user to select one of the birds to move and take this as an input
# Prompt the user to enter the direction the bird has been travelling and take this as an input
# Prompt the user to enter the time to the nearest minute that the bird has been travelling and take this as an input
# call the appropriate method to update the chosen bird’s position
# • output an update on the bird’s new position.
# Each input needs to repeat until valid data is entered. All outputs must be meaningful.
